## Logo Interpretation  
The Spin the Web Foundation logo features the symbols **π** and **σ**, representing a foundational duality:

- **π (pi)** stands for **solidity** — a constant, universal structure anchoring the architecture.  
- **σ (sigma)** reflects **adaptive variation** — the capacity to respond to context, change, and complexity.

Together, they express our motto **Visualize then Realize** where conceptual clarity (π) meets executable adaptability (σ).

# Spin the Web Foundation  
**Weaving Web Portals**

Spin the Web Foundation is a non-profit steward of open standards, tools, and documentation for building enterprise web portals, aka, portals.

We maintain two foundational deployments:

- [**book**](https://github.com/spintheweb/book) – a publication outlining the principles, philosophy, and governance models for decentralized portals. It serves as the conceptual foundation for architects, contributors, and institutional stakeholders.

- [**webspinner**](https://github.com/spintheweb/webspinner) – a containerized sandbox for the Spin the Web framework. It enables the deployment and management of a single portal, translating architectural principles into working implementations.

**The book defines the vision. The container enacts it.**

## Schemas Repository

- [**schemas**](https://github.com/spintheweb/schemas) – A centralized repository of formal schemas used in Spin the Web portals. It defines the structural contracts for datasources, contents, layouts, and interactions. These schemas ensure consistency, validation, and interoperability across deployments and tooling.

The `schemas` repository supports both contributors and integrators by providing a single source of truth for WBDL and WBLL specifications. It is actively maintained and versioned to reflect evolving standards within the Foundation.

---

## Documentation & Governance  
- [**docs**](https://github.com/spintheweb/docs) – Governance, contribution guides, and community resources.

All documentation is maintained with clarity and minimalism in mind.

## Why It Matters  
Enterprise systems are often fragmented and siloed.  
We believe in a web where systems communicate, adapt to roles and contexts, and remain open and interoperable.

---

## Support Our Work  
We exist solely through sponsorship.  
Become a sponsor and help us keep the web open, interoperable, and enterprise-ready.
