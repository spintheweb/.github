## Logo Interpretation

The Spin the Web Foundation logo features the symbols **π** and **σ**, representing a foundational duality:

- **π (pi)** stands for **solidity**—a constant, universal structure that anchors the architecture.
- **σ (sigma)** reflects **adaptive variation**—the capacity to respond to context, change, and complexity.

Together, they express our core principle:  
**Solidity taken to changing power.**

This encapsulates our motto:  
**Visualize then Realize**—where conceptual clarity (π) meets executable adaptability (σ).

# Spin the Web Foundation

**Weaving Web Portals**

Spin the Web Foundation is a non-profit steward of open standards, tools, and documentation for building decentralized, enterprise-grade web portals.

Our architecture is anchored by two foundational deployments:

- **The Book – _Weaving Web Portals_**  
  A TeX-based publication that defines the principles, modular design philosophy, and governance models for decentralized enterprise portals. It serves as the conceptual foundation for architects, contributors, and institutional stakeholders.

- **The Docker Container – `framework`**  
  A Deno-based runtime environment for deploying modular webbaselets. It embodies the operational logic of the ecosystem, enabling dynamic role/context adaptation and enterprise-grade interoperability.

Together, these form a dual axis:  
**The book defines the vision. The container enacts it.**

## Documentation & Governance

- `docs` – Governance, contribution guides, and community resources  
  All documentation is maintained with clarity and minimalism in mind, supporting both Italian and English audiences.

## Why It Matters

Enterprise systems are often fragmented and siloed. We believe in a web where systems communicate, adapt to roles and contexts, and remain open and interoperable.
