## Our Workspace

Spin the Web is organized into four core repositories:

- **[schemas](https://github.com/spintheweb/schemas)**  
  _WBDL core:_ Defines the **Webbase Description Language (WBDL)**. While HTML describes a single web page, WBDL describes an entire web portal!

- **[book](https://spintheweb.github.io/book/SpinTheWeb.pdf)**  
  _Living documentation:_ An evolving textbook covering philosophy, architecture, implementation, usage, and future directions.

- **[webspinner](https://github.com/spintheweb/webspinner)**  
  _WBDL runtime:_ A full-duplex server interpreting WBDL, handling portal requests, and delivering dynamic web experiences.

- **[project](https://github.com/spintheweb/project)**  
  _Project administration:_ Governance, sustainability, and community coordination.
