## Logo Interpretation  
The Spin the Web Foundation logo features the symbols **π** and **σ**, representing a foundational duality:

- **π (pi)** stands for **solidity** — a constant, universal structure anchoring the architecture.  
- **σ (sigma)** reflects **adaptive variation** — the capacity to respond to context, change, and complexity.

Together, they express our motto **Visualize then Realize** where conceptual clarity (π) meets executable adaptability (σ).

# Spin the Web Foundation  
**Weaving Web Portals**

Spin the Web Foundation is a non-profit steward of open standards, tools, and documentation for building decentralized, enterprise-grade web portals.

We maintain two foundational deployments:

- [**book**](https://github.com/spintheweb/book) – a publication outlining the principles, philosophy, and governance models for decentralized enterprise portals. It serves as the conceptual foundation for architects, contributors, and institutional stakeholders.

- [**webspinner**](https://github.com/spintheweb/webspinner) – a containerized sandbox for the Spin the Web framework. It enables the deployment and management of a single modular web portal, translating architectural principles into working implementations.

**The book defines the vision. The container enacts it.**

---

## Documentation & Governance  
- [**docs**](https://github.com/spintheweb/docs) – Governance, contribution guides, and community resources.

All documentation is maintained with clarity and minimalism in mind.

## Why It Matters  
Enterprise systems are often fragmented and siloed.  
We believe in a web where systems communicate, adapt to roles and contexts, and remain open and interoperable.

---

## Support Our Work  
We exist solely through sponsorship.  
Become a sponsor and help us keep the web open, interoperable, and enterprise-ready.
