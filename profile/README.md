The **Spin the Web Foundation** is a non-profit steward of **open standards**, **tools**, and **documentation** for building **decentralized, enterprise-grade web portals**.

Our mission is simple yet ambitious:  
> **Unify diverse enterprise systems into a single, role-aware digital channel — empowering organizations to deliver consistent, secure, and personalized experiences.**

---

## What We Do

We maintain and evolve a framework that makes enterprise portals more **modular**, **interoperable**, and **future-proof**.

### **Our Projects**
- **Spin the Web Framework** – A modern, Deno-based platform for building modular, dynamic portals.
- **Weaving Digital Portals (Book)** – A work-in-progress guide to the philosophy, architecture, and implementation of Spin the Web.
- **Foundation Documentation** – Governance, contribution guides, and community resources.

---

## Why It Matters

Enterprise systems are often fragmented, siloed, and hard to integrate.  
We believe in a **web where systems talk to each other**, where portals adapt to **roles and contexts**, and where **open standards** keep organizations in control of their technology.
