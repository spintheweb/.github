## Logo Interpretation

The Spin the Web Foundation logo features the symbols **π** and **σ**, representing a foundational duality:

- **π (pi)** stands for **solidity**—a constant, universal structure that anchors the architecture.
- **σ (sigma)** reflects **adaptive variation**—the capacity to respond to context, change, and complexity.

Together, they express our core principle:  
**Solidity taken to changing power.**

This encapsulates our motto:  
**Visualize then Realize**—where conceptual clarity (π) meets executable adaptability (σ).

**Weaving Web Portals**

Spin the Web Foundation is a non-profit steward of open standards, tools, and documentation for building decentralized, enterprise-grade web portals.

There are two foundational deployments:

- `[book](https://github.com/spintheweb/book)` - a publication that defines the principles, modular design philosophy, and governance models for decentralized enterprise portals. It serves as the conceptual foundation for architects, contributors, and institutional stakeholders.

- `[webspinner](https://github.com/spintheweb/webspinner)` - a Docker container that hosts an enterprise web portal along with its development environment (Spin the Web Studio).

Together, these form a dual axis:  
**The book defines the vision. The container enacts it.**

## Documentation & Governance

- `[docs](https://github.com/spintheweb/docs)` – Governance, contribution guides, and community resources  
  All documentation is maintained with clarity and minimalism in mind, supporting both Italian and English audiences.

## Why It Matters

Enterprise systems are often fragmented and siloed. We believe in a web where systems communicate, adapt to roles and contexts, and remain open and interoperable.

## Support Our Work

We exist solely through sponsorship.  
Become a sponsor and help us keep the web open, interoperable, and enterprise-ready.
