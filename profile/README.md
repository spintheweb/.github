**Spin the Web** is a framework for building enterprise web portals *portals* that virtualize the company brandâ€”_eBranding_. It addresses the persistent challenge of unifying heterogeneous enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, BPMS, and MRP systems) behind a single, role-aware digital channel, providing consistent abstractions over disparate backends.

The framework comprises three core components:
1. **Webbase Description Language (WBDL)**: A declarative language for modeling portal structure, content, and behavior.
2. **Web Spinner**: An engine that interprets webbases (modular portal definitions written in WBDL) to dynamically generate personalized user experiences with real-time content delivery and role-based authorization.
3. **Spin the Web Studio**: An authoring webbaselet for in-place editing of webbases; it also serves as a laboratory for exercising the Web Spinner.
