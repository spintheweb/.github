\textbf{Spin the Web} is a framework for building enterprise web portals (``portals'') that virtualize the company brandâ€”\textit{eBranding}. It addresses the persistent challenge of unifying heterogeneous enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, BPMS, and MRP systems) behind a single, role-aware digital channel, providing consistent abstractions over disparate backends.

The framework comprises three core components:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Webbase Description Language (WBDL)}: A declarative language for modeling portal structure, content, and behavior.
\item \textbf{Web Spinner}: An engine that interprets webbases (modular portal definitions written in WBDL) to dynamically generate personalized user experiences with real-time content delivery and role-based authorization.
\item \textbf{Spin the Web Studio}: An authoring webbaselet for in-place editing of webbases; it also serves as a laboratory for exercising the Web Spinner.
\end{enumerate}
