# Spin the Web Foundation

**Weaving the Future of Enterprise Web Portals**

We are a non‑profit steward of **open standards**, **tools**, and **documentation** for building **decentralized, enterprise‑grade web portals**.

## Our Projects
- **[book](https://github.com/spintheweb/book)** – *Weaving Web Portals*, the official guide

## Why It Matters
Enterprise systems are often fragmented and siloed. We believe in a **web where systems talk to each other**, adapt to **roles and contexts**, and remain **open and interoperable**.

## Support Our Work
We exist **solely through sponsorship**.  
[**Become a Sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/spintheweb) and help us keep the web open, interoperable, and enterprise‑ready.
