# Spin the Web Foundation

**Weaving Web Portals**

The **Spin the Web Foundation** is a non-profit steward of **open standards**, **tools**, and **documentation** for building **decentralized, enterprise-grade web portals**.

Our mission is to unify diverse enterprise systems into a single, role-aware digital channel — empowering organizations to deliver consistent, secure, and personalized experiences.

## Our Projects

We maintain and evolve a suite of open projects:

- **[book](https://github.com/spintheweb/book)** – *Weaving Digital Portals*, the official guide (work in progress)
- **[framework](https://github.com/spintheweb/framework)** – A modern, Deno-based platform for building modular, dynamic portals
- **[docs](https://github.com/spintheweb/docs)** – Governance, contribution guides, and community resources

---

## Why It Matters

Enterprise systems are often fragmented, siloed, and hard to integrate.  
We believe in a **web where systems talk to each other**, where portals adapt to **roles and contexts**, and where **open standards** keep organizations in control of their technology.

## Background

HTML is interpreted by a web browser. **WBDL** is interpreted by a **web spinner**.

In the late 1990s, while freelancing for an Italian jewelry business with a nationwide sales force, distributed points of sale, international suppliers, and in-house designers, I encountered the challenges of integrating diverse systems.  
The company relied on **Lotus Notes**, a collaborative client–server platform from IBM, to replicate data from a proprietary NoSQL database and provide front ends for internal use. It powered everything from product catalogs to help desk knowledge bases.

While developing a proof of concept to integrate manufacturers, I saw the potential of **dynamic web pages** — assembling content on the fly from multiple data sources into a coherent, browser-based interface. This sparked the idea of using web technologies internally to build a **portal** for employees, sales teams, suppliers, and customers.

To make this systematic, three components were needed:

1. **WBDL (Webbase Description Language)** – A structured language to describe entire web spaces: content, organization, routing, authorization, and internationalization.
2. **Web Spinner** – An interpreter that, given a URL, fetches the associated WBDL fragment and renders it.
3. **Spin the Web Studio** – An environment for managing WBDL efficiently.

Since its inception, WBDL has remained as relevant as HTML — able to describe complex web spaces despite the internet’s rapid evolution.
